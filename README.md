APLICATION
====================================================
"La foto del día" is an aplication that can download, modify and share photos published by NASA day to day in your webpage.
https://api.nasa.gov/index.html
https://data.nasa.gov/developer

Works on Windows and Android devices and is created in Delphi 10.1 Berlin.

It uses different elements of Delphi, which combine to generate this multiplattform application.

* REST, JSON, access to WebServices.
* Effects on images and transitions.
* Modify bitmaps and apply transformations.
* Multitheading.
* ...

The application is based (although it extends the functionalities) in one that I created in my blog to test some funcitionalities.
